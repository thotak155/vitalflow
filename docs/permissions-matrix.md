# VitalFlow V1 Permission Matrix

**Status:** Design proposal. The current runtime ([packages/auth/src/rbac.ts](../packages/auth/src/rbac.ts)) uses a coarser first-pass permission set; this document defines the module-level V1 model and the migration path from today.

---

## 1. Scope

17 modules × 8 roles × 9 actions.

**Modules**

| # | Module | Primary tables | DB exists? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `patient_records` | `patients`, `patient_contacts`, `patient_coverages` | ✅ |
| 2 | `appointments` | `appointments` | ✅ |
| 3 | `encounters` | `encounters` | ✅ |
| 4 | `notes` | `encounter_notes`, `signatures` | ✅ |
| 5 | `clinical_lists` (problems/allergies/meds) | `problems`, `allergies`, `medications`, `immunizations`, `vitals` | ✅ |
| 6 | `intake_forms` | *(TBD)* | ❌ |
| 7 | `check_in` | *(uses `appointments.status`)* | ⚠️ partial |
| 8 | `billing_dashboard` | `invoices`, `invoice_lines`, `payments`, `charges` | ✅ |
| 9 | `claims` | `claims`, `claim_lines` | ✅ |
| 10 | `denials` | `claim_status_history` (status=denied) | ✅ |
| 11 | `staff_records` | `profiles`, `tenant_members` | ✅ |
| 12 | `credentials` | *(TBD — license/DEA/NPI tracking)* | ❌ |
| 13 | `tasks` | `tasks`, `task_comments` | ✅ |
| 14 | `inventory` | `inventory_items`, `inventory_transactions` | ✅ |
| 15 | `admin_settings` | `tenants`, `feature_flags` | ✅ |
| 16 | `audit_logs` | `audit.*` | ✅ |
| 17 | `entitlements` | `entitlements`, `feature_flag_overrides` | ✅ |

**Roles**: `super_admin` (platform), `practice_owner`, `office_admin`, `physician`, `nurse_ma`, `scheduler`, `biller`, `patient`.

**Actions**: `view`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `sign`, `export`, `assign`, `approve`, `manage`.

Not every action applies to every module — see §4.

---

## 2. Design principles

1. **Tenant isolation is not a permission** — it's an RLS predicate. Every query adds `tenant_id = current_tenant_id()`. A role never grants cross-tenant access.
2. **Three enforcement layers, in order:**
   - **Postgres RLS** — authoritative. Runs inside the DB, can't be bypassed by a forgotten check in the app.
   - **SQL `public.has_permission(role[], permission)`** — used in RLS predicates and RPCs.
   - **TypeScript guards** — fast UI feedback + defense-in-depth for actions that can't be expressed in RLS (e.g., export pipelines).
3. **UI hides, backend enforces.** A disabled button is a UX courtesy; a 403 on the server is the real check.
4. **Patient users are fully separated.** `user_kind='patient'` cannot be assigned any staff permission. Patient permissions are `self:*` only, scoped via `patient_portal_links`.
5. **Impersonation strips sensitive perms.** See §7.
6. **Deletion is rare.** HIPAA retention rules mean most "deletes" are soft (`deleted_at`). Hard delete is `manage`-gated and audit-logged.

---

## 3. Permission key convention

Format: `<module>:<action>`

```
patient_records:view
patient_records:create
patient_records:update
patient_records:delete
patient_records:export
encounters:sign
notes:amend
claims:submit
claims:approve
tasks:assign
staff_records:manage
audit_logs:export
```

Special namespaces kept:
- `self:*` — patient self-service only
- `platform:*` — super_admin only, cross-tenant
- `ai:*` — cross-cutting (`ai:invoke`, `ai:train`)

See [`packages/auth/src/permissions-v2.ts`](../packages/auth/src/permissions-v2.ts) for the canonical enum.

## 4. Permission matrix

Legend: ✅ = granted, ⬜ = not granted, 🟡 = conditional (see footnotes), ★ = requires two-person approval or impersonation block.

¹ **demographics only** — name, DOB, phone, address, insurance header. No clinical data.
² **self** — patient can view/update only their own record via `patient_portal_links`.
³ **pre-sign** — can edit until the physician signs; after sign, requires amend.
⁴ **non-psych** — excludes notes flagged as psychotherapy (45 CFR 164.501).
★ **two-person / audit-heavy** — export and amend actions write an `audit.audit_log` entry and (for bulk export) require a second approver.

### 4.2 Front-office surface

| Module / Action | super_admin | practice_owner | office_admin | physician | nurse_ma | scheduler | biller | patient |

| `billing:write_off`       | ✅ | ✅★ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | 🟡 <$500⁵ | ⬜ |

⁵ **threshold-gated** — biller can write off up to a tenant-configured limit without approval; above that, owner sign-off required. Enforced server-side via `billing:approve_writeoff` check in the RPC.

### 4.4 Administrative surface

| Module / Action | super_admin | practice_owner | office_admin | physician | nurse_ma | scheduler | biller | patient |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `staff_records:view`     | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |

| `inventory:manage`       | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |

⁶ **not owner** — office_admin can remove/edit anyone *except* `practice_owner`. Only another owner can demote an owner.
⁷ **self** — clinicians manage their own DEA/NPI/license records but not peers'.

### 4.5 Platform & audit surface

| Module / Action | super_admin | practice_owner | office_admin | physician | nurse_ma | scheduler | biller | patient |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `admin_settings:view`    | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| `admin_settings:update`  | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 non-billing⁸ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| `admin_settings:manage`  | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| `audit_logs:view`        | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| `audit_logs:export`      | ✅ | ✅★ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| `entitlements:view`      | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| `entitlements:manage`    | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |

⁸ **non-billing** — office_admin can change branding, hours, integrations, but not pricing/plan/BAA flags (those are `admin_settings:manage`).

## 5. Route protection rules

Every Next.js route maps to a required permission set and surface group:

```ts
// Convention: colocate a `route.meta.ts` sibling to page.tsx
export const meta = {
  surface: "provider",                   // or "admin" | "patient"
  requires: ["encounters:view"],         // at least one
  requiresAll: [],                       // must have all if set
  impersonationAllowed: true,
};
```

**Enforcement order** (top of every page/action):
1. `requireSession()` → 401 if no cookie or Supabase session.
2. `requireSurface(ctx, meta.surface)` → 403 if wrong `user_kind` or no surface anchor permission.
3. `requireAnyPermission(ctx, meta.requires)` → 403.
4. `requireAllPermissions(ctx, meta.requiresAll)` → 403.
5. If `!meta.impersonationAllowed && isImpersonating(ctx)` → 403.

**Middleware responsibility** (`apps/web/src/middleware.ts`):
- Refresh Supabase session cookie (already done).
- Attach `x-vf-tenant-id` header for downstream.
- Do **not** perform permission checks — that's per-route.

**404 vs 403 policy**: unknown route → 404. Known route, no permission → 403. Don't leak existence of admin-only pages via distinct errors — `/admin/billing` returns 404 for a physician (permission-hide), not 403.

---

## 6. UI visibility rules

1. **Nav filtering** ([apps/web/src/nav/*.ts](../apps/web/src/nav)) — every item has a `requires: Permission[]`. The shell filters at render. This is the *only* place UI visibility logic lives.
2. **Action buttons** — each button declares `requires`. Hidden (not disabled) when missing. Example: a "Sign note" button is invisible to `nurse_ma`.
3. **Read-only fallback** — when a user has `view` but not `update`, render the same form read-only. Do not hide the data.
4. **Never rely on UI alone** — every action that changes data re-checks permission server-side.
5. **Empty-state messaging** — when RLS filters out all rows (e.g. scheduler viewing notes), show "You don't have access to this information" rather than "No records found" — users can tell the difference and it's an integrity signal.

---

## 7. Backend enforcement rules

1. **Postgres RLS** is the backstop. Every table has a policy. Example:
   ```sql
   create policy "notes_read" on public.encounter_notes
     for select using (
       public.is_member_of(tenant_id)
       and public.has_permission(public.current_roles(tenant_id), 'notes:view')
     );
   ```
2. **Row-shape filtering** — `patient_records:view` with scheduler role returns only demographic columns. Enforce via a **view** (`public.patients_demographics_v`) that RLS-protects the full table.
3. **Column-level** — for psychotherapy notes, use a `psych` boolean column + RLS predicate excluding it from `notes:view` unless caller has `clinical:sign` (proxy for "is a clinician").
4. **Server actions** call `requireAllPermissions(ctx, [...])` at the top. Never pass `ctx` from the client.
5. **RPCs for privileged writes** — `claims:approve`, `billing:adjust`, `encounters:amend` are all `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs that re-check caller identity inside the function. No direct table mutations from the client.
6. **Audit-write side effect** — actions marked ★ must insert into `audit.audit_log` as part of the same transaction. If the audit insert fails, the action rolls back.

---

## 8. Edge cases

1. **Multi-tenant users** — a user who belongs to two practices has two `tenant_members` rows. The active tenant is resolved by subdomain (`TENANT_ROUTING_MODE=subdomain`); `getSession()` picks the matching membership. Cross-tenant tasks/appointments are **not allowed**.
2. **User with zero active memberships** — soft-deleted from every practice. Treated as unauthenticated (redirected to `/login`). Do not show "invited but not joined" UI yet; that comes with the invitation flow.
3. **Platform admin with no impersonation** — can hit `/admin` on the platform surface (cross-tenant dashboards) but NOT any tenant-scoped route. Must start an impersonation session to access a tenant.
4. **Last owner protection** — `tenant_members_enforce_owner` trigger (already live) blocks removing the final `practice_owner`. Offboarding UI must detect this and force role-transfer first.
5. **Patient user exists in staff context** — if a staff member has a patient record at the same practice (e.g., the physician's own chart), their patient data is visible only via `self:*` permissions in the patient portal, never via staff routes.
6. **Clock skew on impersonation expiry** — session expiry is DB-side (`now() > expires_at`). Don't check in the browser.
7. **Deletion vs. amendment** — amending a signed note does **not** replace it; the original stays, amended version is a new row linked via `amended_from_id`. The "delete note" action is disabled for signed notes.
8. **Role grant during impersonation** — `admin:users` is stripped by impersonation ([rbac.ts:100-106](../packages/auth/src/rbac.ts#L100-L106)). A super_admin impersonating a practice_owner cannot hand out new roles.
9. **Bulk export as a permission** — `patient_records:export`, `notes:export`, `audit_logs:export`, `claims:export` are *distinct* from `view` because they generate PHI artifacts that leave the app boundary. Always audit-logged.
10. **Service users** (integrations) — `user_kind='service'` with a limited permission set (usually `patient:read`, `billing:read` + integration-specific writes). Bound to an API key, no login UI.
11. **Feature-gated modules** — a tenant on `plan='starter'` may not have `claims` enabled. Check `entitlements` before showing the nav item; RLS on `claims` table should also enforce.

---

## 9. Security risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Developer forgets a permission check in a route | RLS catches it at the DB layer |
| TS permission map drifts from SQL | CI test diffs them (TODO — not yet written) |
| Impersonation abused for edits | Sensitive perms stripped + all actions audit-logged with `impersonator_id` |
| Patient record export leaked | `*:export` perms separate from `view`; all exports audit-logged; UI confirms intent |
| Tenant context forgotten in a query | `SECURITY INVOKER` + RLS; no `SECURITY DEFINER` without explicit tenant param |
| Privilege escalation via role self-edit | `staff_records:update` excludes role changes; role changes require `staff_records:manage` |
| Stale session after offboarding | Middleware refreshes session each request; `tenant_members.deleted_at` causes `getSession()` to return null on next tick |
| Patient portal user gains staff access | Separate `user_kind`, separate surface, no shared routes; `permissionsFor()` returns empty for non-staff kinds |
| Cross-practice data bleed | All tables `tenant_id NOT NULL`; RLS predicates uniformly apply `is_member_of(tenant_id)` |
| Weak passwords | Supabase min length 12 + HIBP check (enable in Dashboard); MFA required before v1.0 |

---

## 10. Migration from current coarse permissions

Current [rbac.ts](../packages/auth/src/rbac.ts) has ~30 coarse keys (`clinical:write`, `billing:read`). The V1 matrix has ~90 keys.

**Strategy: two-phase, non-breaking.**

**Phase 1** (1 PR): Add the new `permissions-v2.ts` alongside the existing `rbac.ts`. Introduce `hasPermissionV2()` helpers. Start annotating new routes/actions with V2 keys. Existing routes keep using V1 keys.

**Phase 2** (subsequent PRs, one surface at a time):
- Translate V1 → V2 for one surface.
- Update the matching RLS policies in a new migration (additive: `has_permission_v2()` SQL function).
- Remove V1 keys for that surface once all call sites converted.
- Drop V1 keys + `has_permission()` after last surface migrated.

**Drift check** (add in Phase 1):
```ts
// packages/auth/test/permission-sql-sync.test.ts
test("TS ROLE_PERMISSIONS matches public.has_permission()", async () => {
  const sqlRows = await sql`SELECT role, permission FROM role_permissions_view`;
  expect(roleMapAsRows(ROLE_PERMISSIONS_V2)).toEqual(sqlRows);
});
```

## 11. Recommended TypeScript API

See [`packages/auth/src/permissions-v2.ts`](../packages/auth/src/permissions-v2.ts) for the generated constants, role-map, and helpers.

Key exports:
- `MODULES`, `ACTIONS` — const arrays (source of truth for enum generation).
- `PERMISSIONS_V2` — frozen array of all valid `module:action` keys.
- `ROLE_PERMISSIONS_V2` — role → Permission[] map.
- `hasPermissionV2(ctx, perm)` / `requirePermissionV2(ctx, perm)` — guards.
- `permissionsForRolesV2(roles, opts)` — same signature as today's `permissionsFor`, returns V2 set.
- `filterModuleActions(roles, module)` — returns the allowed actions for a given module (useful for UI gating).
